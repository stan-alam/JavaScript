## Notes on rediscover JS

```text
JavaScript is no longer to be feared or loathed – the world’s most popular
and ubiquitous language has evolved into a respectable language. Whether you’re
writing frontend applications or server side code, the phenomenal features from
ES6 and beyond – like the rest operator, generators, destructuring, object literals,
arrow functions, modern classes, promises, async, and metaprogramming capabilities –
will get you excited and eager to program with JavaScript. You’ve found the right
book to get started quickly and dive deep into the essence of modern JavaScript.
Learn practical tips to apply the elegant parts of the language and the gotchas to avoid.
JavaScript is a black swan that no one, including the author of the language,
thought would become a popular and ubiquitous language. Not long ago, it was the
most hated and feared language you could use to program the web. JavaScript ES6
and beyond has gone through a significant makeover. Troublesome features have been
replaced with better, elegant, more reliable alternatives.
Write concise, elegant, and expressive JavaScript with newer features like default parameters,
template literals, rest and spread operators, destructuring, arrow functions, and generators.
Take it up a notch with features like infinite series, promises, async, and
metaprogramming to create flexible, powerful, and extensible libraries.
While the evolved features of the language will draw you in, the hundreds
of examples in this book will pin the concepts down, for you to use on your
projects. Take command of modern JavaScript and unlock your potential to create
powerful applications.
