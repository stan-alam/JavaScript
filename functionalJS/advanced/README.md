## Notes on More advanced Functional JavaScript

* Create more reliable code with closures and immutable data

* Convert existing methods into pure functions, and loops into recursive methods

* Develop more powerful applications with currying and function composition

* Separate the logic of your system from implementation details

* Implement composition and chaining techniques to simplify coding

* Use functional programming techniques where it makes the most sense
