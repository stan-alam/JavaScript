**What functional programming term means:**

A function in mathematics can be written as follows, f(x) = y

"A function F, which takes X as its argument and returns the out Y."

	* A function must always take an argument.

	* A function must always return a value.

	* A function should act only on its receiving arguments (i.e, X ) not the outside world.

	* For a given X, there will be only one Y.



functional programming techniques are heavily based on mathematical functions and its ideas.

e.g

```javascript

var percentValue = 5;
var calculateTax = ( value ) => { return value/100 * ( 100 + percentValue ) }

```
